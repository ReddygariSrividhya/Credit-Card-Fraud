# Credit-Card-Fraud
## Overview:
Credit card fraud is rising, challenging banks to detect fraud in real time with low false positives. This project builds a machine learning model using transaction data to accurately spot fraud, helping financial institutions prevent losses and protect customers.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions while minimizing false positives. The model will be trained on historical transaction data, which will be used to identify patterns and anomalies in the data that can indicate fraudulent behavior.

## Process:
The project will follow the following methodology:
1. Data Collection: The first step will be to collect credit card transaction data, including both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The data will be obtained from publicly available datasets, such as Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data will be preprocessed to remove any missing or irrelevant information. This step will also involve feature engineering to create new features that can improve the performance of the machine learning model.
3. Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, will be evaluated to select the best-performing model for credit card fraud detection.
4. Model Training: The selected model will be trained on the preprocessed data using techniques such as cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
5. Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained model will be evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The model will be compared with other state-of-the-art models to determine its effectiveness.
6. Expected Outcomes: The expected outcome of this project is a highly accurate machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. The model will be able to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, while minimizing false positives. This will help financial institutions to prevent financial losses due to fraudulent activities, and protect their customers from potential fraud.

## Conclusion:
Credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions and their customers. Machine learning algorithms can help detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. This project aims to develop a credit card fraud detection model using machine learning that can be deployed in a production environment. The model will help financial institutions to detect and prevent fraudulent activities and protect their customers.
